*interface for computational room acoustics*


## TODO
- Clear chart data when clearing from the raytracer properties panel
- Change the logic for numeric inputs to allow for easy decimal values and negatives
- Hotkeys for menu items
- FDTD computation logic (in rust)
- Calcs for obtaining acoustic parementers from raytracer
- Method for configuring the polar response for sources/receivers
- Show help tooltip when hovering a label (with small delay)
